# Turbin3 Capstone Project

## Overview

SOL Journey provides a spiritual toolkit for users to level up their spiritual practices, reflect on their progress and
connect with other spiritual travelers. The Solana mobile dapp encourages users to stick to their spiritual goals using
their own assets while still allowing them to put those assets to work in DeFI. Users attest their meditation sessions
on-chain and record daily reflections via the journaling feature. SOL Journey secures all data and keeps it private
using the user's wallet. To build community and provide support for each other, users can share their progress and
insights with others using a soul-bound NFTs and a reputation system. Users can connect their biometrics device during
meditation sessions to add additional proof-of-meditation and demonstrate their relative skill-level to the community.
